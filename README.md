# Virtual-Memory-Simulator
An implementation of a critical component in Virtual Memory systems: the two-level page table. With a physical address space of 12-bits and a 14-bit virtual address space, each page table is contained within a single page and features 4-byte entries. The page size is 64B and the memory is byte addressable.
